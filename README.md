# Kaggle BirdCLEF 2022

Birds are all around us, and just by listening to them we can learn a lot about our surroundings. Ecologists use birds to understand food systems and the health of environments - for example, if there are more woodpeckers in a forest, it means that there is a lot of dead wood. On the other hand, because birds communicate and mark their territory with songs and calls, it is more effective to identify them based on audio.
